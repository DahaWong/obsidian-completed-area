En | [简](https://github.com/DahaWong/obsidian-completed/blob/main/README_zh.md)

⚠️ *This is an alpha version, it may contain bugs, and more features are developing.*


## Use
- Click the icon on left sidebar, then the **completed to-do items** will be moved to completed area.

## Preference

### Set header level
You can set the level of completed area with number from `1` to `6`, standing for `h1` to `h6`. 
Default is `2`, i.e.`h2`.

### Set header name
Default is `Completed`.

### Show icon or not
You can turn sidebar icon off and use command instead, if you don't like sidebar icons.

### Set shortcut
This shortcut/ **should be** the same as the official `toggle to-do items` shortcut, for the sake of removing completed items at once.
